# RAG Architecture: GenAI Pokémon Go Strategy Assistant

## Overview

---

This projects is an end-to-end architecture designed to enhance [Pokémon Go](https://pokemongolive.com/?hl=en) UX. Here 
demonstrates a sequential process involving multiple Large Language Model (LLM) 
`gpt-4` agents, leveraging a [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) system to deliver 
personalized responses.

## Features
- **End-to-End Architecture**: Integration of multiple LLM agents using a 
  sequence-by-sequence process.
- **Personalized Responses**: Utilization of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
  system to tailor interactions.
- **Pokémon-Focused Application**: Designed as a complementary strategy assitant for 
  Pokémon users.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10**: The backbone of our project, ensuring a modern and efficient 
  development environment.
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs 
  with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Faiss Vector Database**: Utilization [Meta's High-Performance Vector Database](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/) to 
  optimize memory usage and speed, with excellent GPU architecture adaptability.
- **Streamlit Application**: A user-friendly interface to interact with the system 
  by a QA-chatbot.
- **Langchain Library**: A library to facilitate the communication between the 
  GPT-4 and the LLM Agents.
- **OpenAI API**: Integration with the OpenAI API to leverage the GPT-4 model.
- **Pokepy**: A Python wrapper for the Pokémon API, providing a simple way to access 
  Pokémon data through Pydantic model input schemas.

## Getting Started

To delve into the architecture and explore the application, please ensure you have 
`Python 3.10` installed, along with the Langchain library and Faiss by Meta.

Important notes:

**System** - The entire setup process is designed for Unix-based systems, so you can 
use the next Makefile commands to run locally your system, otherwise, you can 
replicate the commands of the Makefile in your terminal.

**Environment Variables** - each one of the next commands will `source` the variables 
defined in you `.env` file, so double check that your OpenAI API Key is in place. If 
you want to make permanent changes, you would need to add these variables to your 
shell initialization script (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` for 
Unix/Linux/MacOS, or Environment Variables on Windows).


### Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
make create_venv
```


### Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the Dependencies

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
make install_dev
```

### Install the Test Dependencies

Install the test dependencies using the following command:

```bash
make install_test
```

### Run API Server

Run the API server using the following command:

```bash
make api_server
```

Display the Swagger UI documentation to see the available endpoints at: 
[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Display UI

Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
make display
```

## Usage examples

The following are examples of the different types of interactions that the system 
can handle, which are categorized by the intent type and the structure type.

### Intent Types

`defense_suggestion`: An unknown Pokémon has appeared and the user needs a 
suggestion to use a Pokémon against it. The user must provide the name of the 
Pokémon as part of the input.

`information_request`: The user wants to know more about a Pokémon. In the input, 
the user must provide one of the following input text structures: (1) the name of 
the Pokémon with a request for information, (2) a description of a Pokémon in 
natural language without explicitly mentioning the name of the Pokémon with the 
intention of guessing what the Pokémon is, OR (3) a question about the Pokémon with 
the Pokémon name explicitly mentioned, asking for a specific attribute such as: 
Evolution, Diet, Habitat, Base Stats, etc.

`squad_build`: The user wants to build a squad of Pokémon based on the opponent's 
Pokémon types. The user must provide a list of Pokémon names as part of the input.

`None`: Return GPT-4 own response. The user request does not fall into any of the 
above categories.

**Prompt examples**:

| Intent Type         | Structure Type                 | Example                                                                                                                                            |
